Q: How do I contact customer service about my booking?
A: If you need to contact, phone or email customer service about your booking, it's important first to know who you bought from. The best way to find out who you bought from is to check your confirmation email, or check your bank or card statement for a company name.There are 1000s of travel agencies, airlines, hotels and car hire companies that you can buy from through our site and app. We call them "partners". When you buy from them, they will take your payment (you'll see their name on your bank or credit card statement), contact you to confirm your booking, and provide any help or support you might need.If you bought from one of these partners, you'll need to contact them as they have all the info about your booking. We unfortunately don't have any access to bookings you made with them. You'll find their customer service contact number, email address and other ways to get in touch in your booking confirmation email. Alternatively, you can use the following link to find their contact details.
