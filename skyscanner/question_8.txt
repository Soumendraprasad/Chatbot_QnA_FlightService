Q: Where is my booking confirmation?
A: Following your travel purchase, a booking confirmation should be sent to you via email by the respective company. Do remember to check your spam/junk mail folder, as occasionally, these confirmations might end up there. If you're unable to locate the confirmation, consider reaching out to the company you made the purchase from to gather more information. To identify the appropriate contact, refer to the company name listed alongside the charge on your bank account.
