Q: How do I change or cancel my booking?
A: For inquiries regarding changes, cancellations, refunds, and all aspects of your bookings, it's essential to directly contact the company from which you purchased your travel, as they hold the comprehensive information needed to assist you. Our platform provides access to a wide range of travel agencies, airlines, hotels, and car rental companies for your convenience. When you make a purchase from these travel partners through our site and app, they handle your payment (visible on your bank or credit card statement), confirm your booking, and offer necessary support. If your transaction involves these partners, reaching out to them is necessary, as they possess the booking details. It's important to note that we lack access to bookings made directly through them.
