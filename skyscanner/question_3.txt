Q: How do I search for flights on Skyscanner?
A: Skyscanner's default search setting is configured for return flights, but switching to one-way flights is straightforward. Whether you're using the website, mobile site, or app, you can easily search for one-way flights by choosing the 'one way' option located above the 'From' field, where you enter the departure airport. If you wish to revert to searching for return flights, you can do so by re-selecting the 'Return' option or by clicking within the return date field. This will allow you to resume searching for return flight options seamlessly. Skyscanner's user-friendly interface ensures a smooth transition between these search modes.
