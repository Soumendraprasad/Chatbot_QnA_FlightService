Q:  When I get redirected to a provider’s website the currency is different?
A: Skyscanner grants the flexibility to select your desired currency for price viewing and flight comparisons. However, some airline and travel agent websites might limit the currencies they display or accept for payment. Should these flights be visible on Skyscanner, booking them is typically feasible. It's important to consider that if you choose to pay for a flight in a currency differing from your bank or credit card issuer's, the currency conversion will be managed by them. This could involve an alternate exchange rate compared to Skyscanner's and potential commission charges. For accurate information on the applicable exchange rate, it's recommended to directly contact your bank, ensuring you're well-informed about potential discrepancies in currency conversion expenses.
