Q: What does it mean when I see ‘Non-protected transfers’ or ‘Self-transfer flight’ on Skyscanner?
A: At Skyscanner, our aim is to enhance your travel experience to the fullest, and we recognize that achieving savings on flights contributes to happier travelers. When you initiate a flight search, we present a wide array of diverse options, all designed to ensure you receive the utmost value for your money. However, there's a significant caveat that deserves attention – and we've highlighted it for emphasis. A number of these more affordable choices do come with associated risks, which is why they are priced lower in the first place. Prior to finalizing your booking, our goal is to provide you with the necessary insights to comprehend the commitments you're making. While some of this information might seem intricate, we're committed to delivering the clearest explanations possible.
