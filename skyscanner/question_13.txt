Q: Where is my booking confirmation?
A: After purchasing your travel, you should receive a booking confirmation via email from the respective company. It's advisable to check your spam/junk mail folder, as occasionally these confirmations might be directed there. If you're still unable to locate the confirmation, reaching out to the purchasing company is recommended to gain clarity on the situation. To identify the appropriate contact, cross-reference the company name listed alongside the charge on your bank account, as this will guide you toward the right point of contact for resolution.
