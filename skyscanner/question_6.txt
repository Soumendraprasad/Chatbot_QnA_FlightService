Q: Why have I been blocked from accessing the Skyscanner website?
A: Skyscanner's websites encounter a substantial volume of bot-driven scraping activity daily, which adversely impacts the quality of service we strive to offer. To counter this, we've implemented a bot-blocking solution designed to verify that users interact with the website in a conventional manner. At times, genuine users might find themselves incorrectly flagged as bots due to various potential reasons. These include scenarios such as utilizing a VPN that was blocked due to previous excessive bot traffic, navigating the site at an unusually rapid pace surpassing our rate limits, employing browser plugins that interfere with our website's user interaction, or utilizing an automated browser. If you find yourself blocked while using our services normally, kindly provide us with your IP address (which you can find at websites like http://www.whatismyip.com/), the specific website you were accessing (e.g., www.skyscanner.net), and the date/time when the issue occurred. You can share this information with us through the "Contact Us" button, and we'll promptly investigate and resolve the matter.
