Q: Where can I view and manage the price alerts I have set up?
A: To manage the price alerts you've set up, log in to your Skyscanner account. If you didn't initially create an account, follow the process and click 'forgotten your password?' on the account screen. On the desktop site, log in by clicking 'Log in' at the top; on the mobile site and app, tap and then tap 'Log in'. After logging in on desktop or mobile, access the 'Account' option to navigate to the Price Alert Management section. Here, you can view your active alerts, check the latest prices, initiate immediate searches, stop alerts, or create new ones. On the app, tap the top left corner, then 'Recent searches and Price Alerts' to effectively manage your alerts.
