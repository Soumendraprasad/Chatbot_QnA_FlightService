Q:  How do I find out if my booking has gone through?
A: After making a booking with an airline or travel agent, they will typically send you a confirmation email and initiate the transaction charge on your card or bank account. Keep in mind that these confirmation emails might occasionally be redirected to your spam/junk mail folder, warranting a check there. If the confirmation is still elusive or if uncertainties persist, it's advisable to reach out to the selling company directly for comprehensive information about your booking. Our platform offers access to a diverse range of travel agencies, airlines, hotels, and car rental firms for your purchases, and in cases where you've transacted with these partners, direct contact with them is recommended, as they possess all the pertinent details regarding your booking.
